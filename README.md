<h1>Covid-19-Infograph</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project that I made for WinHacks 2020. The theme this year for the Hackathon is, mobility to fight Covid-19. 
My project highlights the global effects of the Covid-19 virus, as well as some of the necessary things that can be
done to prevent the spread of the virus. 

<h2>Built With</h2>
There are a variety of popular Python libraries and modules used to build the Covid-19-Infograph.
The libraries and modules that were used to build this project were:

<ul>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>TKinter</li>
  <li>PIL</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
  <li>xlrd</li>
  <li>requests</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
The libraries and modules that were mentioned in the "Built With" section are vital to ensuring the program
runs efficiently and without any bugs. Therefore, all of the libraries mentioned above are needed to run
this program. To run the program, we need to install all those libraries and modules. Therefore, here are
the steps to installing all the programs, <i>if they are not installed on your machine<i>. However, if you
would want to check if these libraries and modules are installed, then typing these commands will not waste
any additional space on your machine, or cause any problems:

<li><strong>python3 -m pip install matplotlib</strong> OR <strong>pip install matplotlib</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install numpy</strong> OR <strong>pip install numpy</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install tk</strong> OR <strong>pip install tk</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install Pillow</strong> OR <strong>pip install Pillow</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4</strong> OR <strong>pip install beautifulsoup4</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install xlrd</strong> OR <strong>pip install xlrd</strong></li>
<li><strong>python3 -m pip install requests</strong> OR <strong>pip install requests</strong></li>


<h2>Executing The Program</h2>
In order to execute the program, you can go into the terminal or command prompt, and type in the 
following command: <strong>python3 mainGUI.py</strong><br/>OR<br/><strong>python mainGUI.py</strong>.
